# lovera
Calculation of multi-diffusion domain (MDD) age spectra for the <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar system. Peter Zeitler's C translation of Oscar Lovera's (UCLA) fortran program `ages.f`.  This version has been recoded so that the core Lovera routine can be called as a standalone function (e.g., for incorporation into inversions). This program wraps a simple interface around that function in order to permit simple forward modeling of individual age spectra.

Code will be posted soon (doing some housekeeping first).
